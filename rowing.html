        <h2>Division I Rowing at Northeastern University</h2>
        <p>
          I rowed for four years as a Division I athlete at Northeastern University, where rowing became a foundation for how I approach challenges. Balancing high-level competition with academics taught me discipline, resilience, and how to commit fully to a team over the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond racing, I served as the team's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) representative, helping bridge communication between athletes and the athletic department and advocating for athlete well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rowing shaped how I show up every day—consistent, team-first, and comfortable with hard work.

        <h2>Ambassador — A Most Beautiful Thing Inclusion Fund</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an ambassador for A Most Beautiful Thing Inclusion Fund, an organization using rowing to expand access and opportunity for athletes of color. Through this work, I've seen how sport can build confidence, community, and belonging far beyond competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most meaningful moments was rowing in one of the first all-Black 8+ crews at the Head of the Charles Regatta—a powerful reminder of how visibility and representation can help reshape who feels welcome in the sport.

        <h2>Developing Rowing in Senegal</h2>
        <p>
          Rowing is beginning to take root in Senegal, and I'm proud to be involved in its early development. I currently serve as an advisor to the Senegalese national rowing committee, sharing my experience as a Division I athlete to help shape how young talent is identified, developed, and supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role focuses on offering guidance around training pathways, athlete development, and long-term program building—drawing from what I've learned through collegiate rowing and exposure to international competition. The goal is to help build a sustainable foundation that gives Senegalese athletes access to the sport, opportunities to grow, and a pathway to compete on the global stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work reflects what rowing has always meant to me: a vehicle for growth, education, and community—far beyond the water.
