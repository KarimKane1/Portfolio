          <p>
            I was honored with the Charlie Smith Award, presented to the team member
            who best exemplifies the values of rowing: teamwork, dedication, and
            leadership. This award recognized my commitment to fostering team
            cohesion, contributing to the success of my teammates, and consistently
            striving to lead by example both on and off the water.

          <h2>Disney Case Competition â€“ 3rd Place Finish</h2>
          <p>
            I participated in Walt Disney World's first-ever nationwide Case Study
            Competition, representing Northeastern University. Competing against
            teams from across the United States, my team tackled a real-world
            business challenge with limited data and strict time constraints. We
            developed an innovative solution by creating a detailed project scope,
            defining success metrics, and crafting actionable recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our efforts earned us third place, showcasing our ability to think
            critically, collaborate effectively, and deliver results under pressure.
            This experience not only sharpened my analytical and problem-solving
            skills but also allowed me to engage with Disney professionals and gain
            insights into real-world business operations.
