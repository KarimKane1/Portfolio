          leadership. This award recognized my commitment to fostering team
          cohesion, contributing to the success of my teammates, and consistently
          striving to lead by example both on and off the water.

        <p>
          I was honored as an Empacher-IRCA Scholar-Athlete by the Intercollegiate
          Rowing Coaches Association, recognizing my commitment to both academic
          and athletic excellence. This distinction is awarded to rowers and
          coxswains who have completed at least two years of eligibility, competed
          in their program's top three boats during the current season or raced at
          the IRA Championship, and maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or higher.

        <h2>Disney Case Competition – 3rd Place Finish</h2>
        <p>
          I participated in Walt Disney World’s first-ever nationwide Case Study
          Competition, representing Northeastern University. Competing against
          teams from across the United States, my team tackled a real-world
          business challenge with limited data and strict time constraints. We
          developed an innovative solution by creating a detailed project scope,
          defining success metrics, and crafting actionable recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our efforts earned us third place, showcasing our ability to think
          critically, collaborate effectively, and deliver results under pressure.
          This experience not only sharpened my analytical and problem-solving
          skills but also allowed me to engage with Disney professionals and gain
          insights into real-world business operations.
